Clustering is a unsupervised machine learning and data segmentation technique that divides huge datasets into different groups on the basis of similarity in the data. The resulting groups are known as clusters. K-means clustering with Python is one of the most common clustering techniques.

In order to choose the right K (# of clusters), we can use Elbow method. Elbow method plots the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use. Explained variance (also called explained variation) is used to measure the discrepancy between a model and actual data. In other words, it’s the part of the model’s total variance that is explained by factors that are actually present and isn’t due to error variance.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to perform Unsupervised Machine learning with Python using K-Means Clustering, with the example of identifying clusters of customers based on their age, gender and salary range. I will show you step by step of:

1. How to load the data into Google Colab notebook
2. How to explore the data
3. How to pre-process the data
4. How to perform Elbow method to determine the K value to be used
5. How to perform clustering with using Scikit-Learn library
6. How to evaluate the results of the clustering
